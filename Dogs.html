            <img src="c:\Users\Anishaa\Downloads\maltese-dog.jpg">
           <p>Although it's tough to distinguish between all the small white dog breeds out there, this one counts as one of the oldest. Maltese have entertained their owners for thousands of years. They're so lovable that the ancient Greeks even built tombs in their honor.

        <p>
            <img src="c:\Users\Anishaa\Downloads\alaskan-malamute.jpg">

        <p>
            <img src="c:\Users\Anishaa\Downloads\golden-retriever.jpg">
